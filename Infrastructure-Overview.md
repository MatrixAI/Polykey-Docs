PolyKey is a decentralised distributed peer to peer (P2P) secret sharing & secret
management system. It is intended to be used by both humans and machines.
It synthesise a unified workflow between interactive password management and
infrastructure key management.

This project PolyKey (library) is the core library for running PolyKey. It
provides a CLI `polykey` or `pk` for interacting with the PolyKey system. The
main desktop GUI is located at https://github.com/MatrixAI/PolyKey.

PolyKey involves running distributed keynodes, which we will refer to as "nodes".
A host system can run multiple nodes. Each node manages one or more vaults which
are encrypted filesystems with automatic version history. You can share these
vaults with other users of PolyKey who are running their own keynodes.



## Vaults

A polykey keynode will have an X.509 root certificate. This certificate is a secure way of presenting information for the keynode’s digital identity. The X.509 certfificate contains an asymmetric keypair, namely a root public key and root private key and that is specific to each keynode. These are 4096 bit RSA keys which are protected by a password when the keynode is initialised. When the passphrase is provided, the root keypair can be used for a number of different functions.

### Vault Access

When a new vault is created, it is sealed using a 256 bit symmetric key. This symmetric key is generated by encrypting a random 256 bit buffer using AES and the root private key. To access the derived vault key, the root private key must be known. Each time a new vault is created, a new 256 bit is generated and stored.

### Secret Access

Within each vault there can be a number of secrets. Each secret is protected with an Encrypted File System, which stores a file using AES-GCM encryption. The data is stored in the following form:

`| salt (random, safeguards secrets) | init vector (random, initial state) | auth tag (verify data has not been modified) | encrypted data |`

A virtual file system is also passed to the encrypted files system, in order to create the in-memory file system. Two operations can be performed using the Encrypted File System; reads and writes. In order to maintain security, the secrets are decrypted in memory and not on disk. For write operations, the encrypted file is stored on disk and then stored in memory using the Virtual File System. In read operations, the file is accessed on disk then stored and decrypted in memory using the Virtual File System.

### Root Keypair Rotation

In some cases, the root keypair will need to be replaced with a new keypair or ‘rotated’. There is no need to generate new vault keys or other instances of encrypted data. Instead, the new root keypair can be generated. Then, the required metadata and vault keys are decrypted using the old root keypair and re-encrypted using the new root keypair.  Therefore, PolyKey has now transferred to usage of the new root keypair without the entire removal of all data encrypted by the old root keypair.

### Metadata

In order to keep track of important information after PolyKey has been closed, this data is written on disk. The data that is stored includes the keynode’s gestalt graph, provider tokens, keys and node information.  Some of this information, for example the vault keys of a keynode, needs to be encrypted before being stored in order to maintain security. To do this a bip39 mnemonic is encrypted using the root private key and stored on disk. The Encrypted File System mentioned previously then uses this mnemonic to encrypt the relevant data and store it on disk. This data is loaded and decrypted when required to access certain areas of PolyKey.

### Node ID

In order to interact with other nodes, PolyKey uses a unique node ID identifier. Currently, the fingerprint of the root public key of a keynode is calculated using a sha256 has function and is then transformed into base64 encoding to obtain a keynode’s Node ID. This will consistently produce a string of 44 characters. In the future, PolyKey will used an ed25519 public key directly encoded using base64 to create the Node ID. As the signature of ed25519 keys can be up to 256 bits, the length of the node ID would be a maximum of 44 characters.

## Sharing

The sharing process involves:

1. Social Identity Discovery - given a trusted digital identity, find linked node public keys
2. Node Discovery - given a node public key, find the point of presence (IP address)

### Social Identity Discovery

In Social Identity Discovery, you will discover other digital identities on the
social networks that you trust. These digital identities will be augmented with a
cryptolink that provides information on their keynodes. We use the public key
of the nodes to identify the nodes.

### Node Discovery

In Node Discovery, we use a peer to peer distributed hash table (DHT) and the
kademlia protocol to resolve node public keys to their IP addresses. From here
we can then perform connection attempt.
