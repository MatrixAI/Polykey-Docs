* Digital Identities
* Gestalts
* Social Discovery


In today's world, a person's physical presence can almost entirely be represented by their digital presences across social media providers. For example, a person's Facebook profile can provide information not only about their name and appearance, but also where they have been, who they are acquainted with, and what things they like. Not only do these digital identities contain information, but they can also be used to provide access to services, devices, and secrets.

Secrets, by themselves, cannot be connected to an individual by ownership. Secrets can be shared, leaked, or lost.










Every Polykey user can be represented by a connected graph of keynodes and digital identities, otherwise known as a Gestalt. Keynodes store vaults, which in turn store secrets, and digital identities are the user's digital presences on third-party applications. Keynodes and digital identities are connected through ownership claims; immutable messages created on social media providers and keynode sigchains which are used to form cryptolinks.
