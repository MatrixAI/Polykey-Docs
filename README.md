# Polykey-Docs

Documentation for Polykey. This uses GitHub wiki as a CMS. This wiki is mirrored to Gitlab at https://gitlab.com/MatrixAI/open-source/Polykey-Docs.

GitLab builds the wiki via the CI/CD into static pages, rendering the markdown files and templates it within the branding of [polykey.io](https://polykey.io).

The CI/CD pushes it to [polykey.io/docs](https://polykey.io/docs) which is hosted by Cloudflare's pages and worker system.
