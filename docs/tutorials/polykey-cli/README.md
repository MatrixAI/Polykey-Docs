# Polykey CLI

The Command Line Interface (CLI) of Polykey is the first and primary user-interface (UI) to the Polykey system. The CLI is intended for developers and system administrators.

This is because the idea of Polykey came from our experience dealing with secrets as software engineers during the development and deployment workflow.

New features will always arrive in the CLI first, for testing and integration, before being ported to the other UIs.

We designed the CLI user-experience (UX) to be suitable for a human operator, but also to be easily scripted and integrated into other tools.

The tutorial here should be followed in-order, and the goal is to make use of Polykey to manage secrets for a simple application from development to deployment.

The CLI is open-source and available on GitHub: [Polykey CLI](https://github.com/MatrixAI/Polykey-CLI).

We automatically build and test the CLI on the following platforms:

- Linux x64
- Linux arm64
- MacOS x64
- MacOS arm64
- Windows x64
- Docker

:::warning

Polykey is currently in beta. Its interface is at various levels of stability. So bear with us as we perfect its design.
