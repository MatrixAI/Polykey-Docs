# Secrets Management

Today's digital landscape is a decentralised network of computing systems which includes web and mobile applications, micro-services, devices, Internet of Things and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Managing secret data is essential to the secure usage of this global network.

To understand secrets management, we must first understand how secrets are fundamental to the authentication and authorization of secure computing systems.

Authentication is a procedure for identifying an agent attempting to access a particular resource, and to guarantee that only valid identities are allowed access to a resource. Authentication procedures are implemented as communication protocols between humans and machines, or between machines to other machines.

Authorization is a way of controlling access to resources after the agent is identified. The access to resources have many names including privileges, permissions, authorities or capabilities. Managing authorization means granting, revoking or tracking of privileges to identified agents. Authorization systems are implemented as data-models that assign privileges to agents and resources.

Authentication and authorization can be combined to be solved by a single platform, and such a platform is called "AAA architecture" which stands for "Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting". The accounting part is about tracking privilege use, either for audit logging or for usage rate limiting.

Both authentication protocols and authorization models make use of secret data which can consist of tokens, passwords, keys or certificates in order to facilitate their operation.

For example, you have probably used a secret password or code to authenticate yourself to the device you are using to read this article.
